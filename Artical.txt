C++:
file: AbstractCircle.h
class AbstractCircle{
public:
	virtual void someFunction() = 0;
}

0 means it's empty, and whomever extends the AbstractCircle class needs to implement virtual function.

And the class with virtual function is Abstract class, so class AbstractCircle can't be instanced.


In C++, struct can contain functions.
It's just like a class with all members public.

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) :
    val(x), next(NULL) {}
};


    ListNode(int x) : ---> It's the constructor of this struct
    val(x), ---> means val's initial value would be x
    next(NULL){} ---> and next's initial value would be NULL
    	   ^^^^^ And remember the Priority order would be...
                 1. the small parentheses
		 2. the big parentheses
